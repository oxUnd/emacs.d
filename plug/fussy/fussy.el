;;; Commentary:

;; This is a fuzzy Emacs completion style similar to the built-in
;; `flex' style, but using `flx' for scoring.  It also supports various other
;; fuzzy scoring systems in place of `flx'.

;; This package is intended to be used with packages that leverage
;; `completion-styles', e.g. `completing-read' and
;; `completion-at-point-functions'.

;; It is usable with `icomplete' (as well as `fido-mode'), `selectrum',
;; `vertico', `corfu', `helm' and `company-mode''s `company-capf'.

;; It is not currently usable with `ido' which doesn't support
;; `completion-styles' and has its own sorting and filtering system.  In
;; addition to those packages, other `company-mode' backends will not hook into
;; this package.  `ivy' support can be somewhat baked in following
;; https://github.com/jojojames/fussy#ivy-integration but the
;; performance gains may not be as high as the other `completion-read' APIs.

;; To use this style, prepend `fussy' to `completion-styles'.

;; For improved performance,`fussy-filter-fn' and `fussy-score-fn' for filtering
;; and scoring matches are good initial starting points for customization.

;; The various available scoring backends in `fussy-score-fn' have varying
;; levels of performance and match quality.
;; For a faster version that implements the same matching as `flx', use
;; https://github.com/jcs-elpa/flx-rs which is a native module written in Rust.

;; Other notable scoring backends supported by this package:
;; flx: https://github.com/lewang/flx
;; fzf: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
;; skim: https://github.com/lotabout/fuzzy-matcher

;; For an exhaustive list of scoring backends, take a look at
;; https://github.com/jojojames/fussy#scoring-backends

Some scoring backends \(e.g. Rust backends\) are unable to handle strings with
certain character encoding.  This function is applied to the candidate strings
before they are passed to the scoring function.

This was added specifically for `consult' but other encodings could also pose
a problem.  To keep the performance of the Rust backends useful,
`fussy-without-tofu-char' is set as the default function.
`fussy-without-tofu-char' is an order of magnitude faster than
`fussy-without-unencodeable-chars' but won't handle every case.

Another option is to use `fussy-encode-coding-string' which dumbly converts
a multibytestring without considering what the final string will look like.
Using this may work for the purpose of matching too as the final candidate
string may go from something like abcX to abcR where X was the multibyte char
that is not useable with the above scoring backends and R is a random ascii
character encoded from X.
